# Generative-Art

[Generative Art](https://kamran-afzali.github.io/posts/2021-12-25/aRt.html) is a process of algorithmically generating new ideas, forms, shapes, colors or patterns. First, you create rules that provide boundaries for the creation process. Then a computer  follows those rules to produce new works on your behalf.
